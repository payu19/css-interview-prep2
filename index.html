    <h3>Q.1 What is box sizing?</h3>
    <pre> The box-sizing property allows us to include the padding and border in an element's total width and height.
          If you set box-sizing: border-box; on an element, padding and border are included in the width and height:</pre>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h3>Q.2 What is animation delay?</h3>
    <pre> The animation-delay CSS property specifies the amount of time to wait from applying the animation to an element
          before beginning to perform the animation. The animation can start later, immediately from its beginning, or 
          immediately and partway through the animation.
        </pre>
  </div>

    <h3>Q.3 What is grid-template-columns used for?</h3>
    <pre>The grid-template-columns property in CSS is used to set the number of columns and size of the columns of the grid.
         This property accepts more than one values. The number of columns is set by the number of values given to this property.

    <h3>Q.4 Which property you will use to merge cells vertically in grid?</h3>
    <pre>Merge datagridview row and column cells Perhaps, the most useable solution in that thread is the DataGridViewMergedTextBoxColumn
         class posted by Felice Ferri. This approach allows you to merge DataGridView cells vertically only in particular columns but not
         in every column of the DataGridView.
        </pre>

    <h3>Q.5 Which property you will use to merge cells horizontally in grid?</h3>
    <pre>It is possible to implement horizontally merged cells using the GridViewSettings.HtmlRowCreated property.
         This approach is based on removing one cell from a certain row.

    <h3>Q.6 what is the difference between display none and visibility hidden?</h3>
    <pre>Display  none     = display: none; is commonly used with JavaScript to hide and show elements without deleting and recreating them.
         Visibility hidden = hidden means that unlike display:none, the tag is not visible, but space is allocated for it on the page.
